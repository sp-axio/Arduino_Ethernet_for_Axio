== Ethernet Library for Axio-Builder ==

With the Arduino Ethernet Shield, this library allows an Axio-Builder to connect to the internet.


== How to use ==

* Copy 'w5100.h' file from 'src/utility' and overwrite to your default Ethernet library 'libraries/Ethernet/src/utility/w5100.h'.

* Connect Ethernet Shield to Axio-Builder with jumper wires as shown below.

Note:
* W5100 Ethernet shield uses ICSP pins(SPI) to communicate with the Axio-Builder(Arduino).
* Digital pin 10 is used to SPI SSN.
* This code was tested by the DFRobut Ethernet Shield v2.2.
